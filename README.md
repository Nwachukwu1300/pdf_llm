# Technical Documentation Analysis Pipeline

## Project Goal
Development of a Large Language Model (LLM) specialized in technical documentation analysis and understanding.

## Current Phase: Building the Foundation
### 1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Developing custom patterns to identify key technical entities
- Validating accuracy against manual counts
- Understanding entity occurrences and references

### 2. Relationship Extraction  
- Identifying connections between technical documents
- Capturing relationships between entities
- Building structured relationships for knowledge representation

### 3. Knowledge Graph Construction (Next Step)
- Converting extracted entities to nodes
- Using relationships as edges
- Creating a structured network of technical knowledge

## Implementation Progress
Currently focused on NER development:


### Current Features
- Custom spaCy NER patterns
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multiple format support
- Accuracy validation
- Performance visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- spaCy
- pdfplumber
- matplotlib
- prettytable
- numpy

## Project Roadmap
