# Technical Documentation Entity Recognition and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) for technical documentation analysis, specifically focusing on identifying and analyzing references to technical documents, system components, and related entities within infrastructure documentation.

## Goals
- Develop accurate NER patterns for technical document identification
- Validate model performance against manual counts
- Track document references across multiple technical specifications
- Build foundation for technical documentation knowledge graph
- Provide insights into document relationships and references

## Key Components

### Entity Types
- **TECH_DOC**: Technical document references (e.g., MCE0107B, TR 2043)
- **SYSTEM_COMPONENT**: System identifiers (e.g., MIDAS, NMCS2)
- **HARDWARE_COMPONENT**: Physical components (e.g., Cabinet Type 600, AMI)
- **COMMUNICATION_COMPONENT**: Communication protocols (e.g., RS485, Ethernet LAN)
- **SUBSYSTEM_COMPONENT**: Subsystem identifiers (e.g., Signal Subsystem)
- **CONTROL_COMPONENT**: Control systems (e.g., Control System, CCTV System)
- **SPECIFICATION_TYPE**: Document classifications (e.g., Requirements Document)

### Features
- Custom spaCy NER patterns for technical entity recognition
- Case-insensitive matching with multiple format support
- Accuracy validation against manual counts
- Performance visualization across documents
- Detailed error analysis including missed and extra matches

## Implementation Details

### Text Processing Pipeline
1. PDF text extraction using pdfplumber
2. Text cleaning and normalization
3. Chunking for efficient processing
4. Entity recognition using custom patterns

### Pattern Matching
- Handles various document code formats
- Supports different spacing variations
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multiple entity type recognition

### Validation System
- Compares model findings against manual counts
- Tracks missed and extra matches
- Calculates accuracy metrics
- Provides detailed performance analysis

## Requirements
- spaCy
- pdfplumber
- matplotlib
- prettytable
- numpy
